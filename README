===== DESCRIPTION

Simple (but heavily parameterized) tool for testing genetic algorithms on the traveling saleman problem. All parameters are optional, and have default values; the real value of this tool is to learn how various variables in genetic algorithm impact its efficacy.

===== DEPENDENCIES

Requires Java 5 or later.

===== USAGE

For usage information:

java -Xmx512m -jar GeneticAlgorithm-TravelingSalesman.jar --help

To run with all default values, simply don't pass any parameters:

java -Xmx512m -jar GeneticAlgorithm-TravelingSalesman.jar
